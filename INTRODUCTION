🚀 What is C++?
C++ is a general-purpose, high-performance programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as an extension of the C language. It adds object-oriented features while retaining the speed and low-level access of C.

🧠 Key Features
- Object-Oriented: Supports classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Compiled & Statically Typed: Type checking happens at compile time, improving performance.
- Middle-Level Language: Combines high-level abstraction with low-level system access.
- Cross-Platform: Runs on multiple operating systems with the right compiler.
- Fast Execution: Minimal runtime overhead makes it ideal for performance-critical applications.

🛠️ Common Uses
- Operating systems
- Game development
- Embedded systems
- Real-time simulations
- GUI applications
